The topic pertinent to the issue of the utilization of electronic devices has become hotly debated in contemporary society, among which is the discussion about whether there should be a limit on the number of hours that young children spend using technology. Some individuals propose that we should not limit, citing the reason that the use of technology can improve students' study efficiency. However, as far as I'm concerned, I strongly hold the opinion that we should limit its use. I would provide my reasons in the following paragraphs. 

First, these new technological devices may harm students' eyesight. It is known to us all that electronic devices are the main core to the reduction of students' eyesight especially for those young people. So, it is reasonable to limit the time of use of technology. Take me as a compelling example. When I was a primary school student, the iphone 4 was the latest version of smartphone, which had a lot of functions that we had never seen before. We could touch the screen to play games and talk to the Tom Cat. The completely new smart phone shocked me. I easily indulged in the iphone, focusing on the screen almost all day. Only after a month, I found that I could not see the blackboard clearly. At first I thought it because the light was too dark. However, when my parents found that and sent me to the hospital and took an eyesight test. It was proved that my eyesight has been damaged harmfully. By that time, I came to realize that I had made a huge mistake. Had I used the iphone more regularily, I would have a better eyesight.

First, the competition can stimulate both me and my friend to get better achievement. To be more specific, people will often perform a task better if there is a competitor. The will of winning the game will push you to optimize the result and then, a better result will happen.

Take me as a compelling example. During the last summer vacation, I and my friend took participated in a school campus, which will award the winner a recommendation letter. We need to finish the task that using our own code to recognize people's faces and accuracy was the main standard. At the very first time I had made a program that had achieve 90% accuracy. I was almost ready to load up the code but I saw my friend Tom had reached 95%. I knew that I had to improve my code to get the first class. During that summer campus, I stayed at the lab almost all day and tried to optimize my algorithm and some parameters. Finally I and Tom both achieved the 98%, which was much better than the average level. To our surprise, the professor said this time we can have two winners as Tom and I had achieved over-expected results. Had I not competed with my friends, I would upload the task when I achieve the average level.

In addition, the competition can help you see the character of your friends. A good friend can have many positive personalities, but at least a good friend should not be so jealous or deceived. A competition can help you find out as a man will act differently in the competition. 
Take me and Jimmy as an example. Once we had the same task and who solved the task first could get a lot of money. At first, Jimmy and I stayed in a good relationship. We shared the information and our own working process to improve the working efficiency. Jimmy solved the task before me and I had nothing to complain about. However, after my another friend Kelly saw my working process and told me that I had always worked on the wrong data. Then I corrected that data and the task was easily finished. I reviewed and a fact I didn't want to believe unfolded before my eyes. It was Jimmy who gave me the wrong data while he was using the right one. I was angry and asked him for a reason. He said nothing and our friendship ended. It is not acceptable for me to get along with a liar. It was this competition that helped me see my friend's character.
