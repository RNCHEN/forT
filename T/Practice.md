The large crowds will have a negative impact on our good feeling.  To be more specific, the long queue will waste my time on waiting while I only need 10 percent of time in less popular place. 

Take me as an example. Last summer vacation, I invited my family to the Tai Mountain, which is the most popular mountain at that time. At the beginning of the travel, I was happy and could not waiting to see the spectacular view. However, when we drove to the parking place, we saw a 50 meters long car queue, which means we need to take an hour at least to park the car. After a long meaningless waiting, we finally parked the car and our exciting mood is down. The situation is completely opposite from mine for my brother, who chose to go to a less popular place. There is no waiting queue for parking and entrance.  At last, I can just be jealous of his travel while I am regretting making a wrong choice to go to popular place.

The view in some less popular places is much more beautiful than some deceptive popular places. It is a fact that those photos of popular places, usually, are modified by photoshop while the real view is just average. 

For instance, the Maldives, which is an island that prevails among young people, is not as beautiful as what the advertisement says. The real difference between it and any other island in China is that people speak English on Maldives. The real place of those imaginary photos or videos is just an ordinary place without any charming sunshine or ease sea wind. However, Samui, which is an island lines near the Maldives but much less popular, is that place that can shock you with its gorgeous scenery. It is the narrow but cozy coastline and clear water that makes me comfortable. At least in my opinion, a place like Samui with less popularity but more views will be my choice compared with other prevail choices.

It is cheaper to cook at home. To be more specific, if I choose to cook at home with all ingredients prepared, the cost will be controlled in a reasonable range, which is often a half of the cost spent in restaurant.

Take myself as an example. Especially for vegetable,I can purchase 1 kilogram tomatoes, which can be cooked for a week, for 6 yuan, but I need to pay 4 times for one dish in a common restaurant that even do not have a full tomato.  Even if I buy the so-called organic vegetable, the cost is still lower than half of the bill in restaurant. What's worse, the cost is higher in some metropolitans. Last summer vacation during my internship, I tried to cook at home to shorten the daily cost. To my surprise, I found that my money saved can support me to have a trip nearby, which is impossible if I ate outside.

It is healthier to cook at home. It is obviously that we ourselves will use fresher food or reasonable amount of condiment.  

For instance, if we cook at home, we will probably go to the market in the early morning to buy the freshest meat or vegetable while the restaurant might use the food, which is out of date already. The rotten part will cause children to have a stomach or some other relative symptoms and even they need to go to the hospital. In addition, some cookers may use unhealthy condiment to make the meal delicious, but the victim are customers. Using too much salt or pepper or oil can attract their appetite. However, there are so many paper or statistics about excessive intake of oil or salt, which can lead to sub-health. 







To begin with, fictional movies can make people more relaxed and more confident about life after watching them. People can immerse themselves in the world that the movie imagines.

 For example, when I study for a whole day, I will choose to watch a fictional movie such as Frozen.

 I can focus on the beautiful ice world created by Elsa without thinking about the hard work of the day, thus releasing my pressure. 

Films made based on reality often reflect some social problems, such as vulnerable groups. 

The famous Korean film Melting Pot is an example of this. 

Teachers in schools beat and sexually assaulted those students, but they were not punished by the law. 

People often feel depressed after watching these cruel and violent movies. 

At the same time, people will also feel sadness and pain for the tragic characters in the real events, which will not be healed for a long time. 

Thus, I hold to watch fictional films about imaginary people and places.
