The topic pertinent to the issue of the utilization of electronic devices has become hotly debated in contemporary society, among which is the discussion about whether there should be a limit on the number of hours that young children spend using technology. Some individuals propose that we should not limit, citing the reason that the use of technology can improve students' study efficiency. However, as far as I'm concerned, I strongly hold the opinion that we should limit its use. I would provide my reasons in the following paragraphs. 

First, these new technological devices may harm students' eyesight. It is known to us all that electronic devices are the main core to the reduction of students' eyesight especially for those young people. So, it is reasonable to limit the time of use of technology. Take me as a compelling example. When I was a primary school student, the iphone 4 was the latest version of smartphone, which had a lot of functions that we had never seen before. We could touch the screen to play games and talk to the Tom Cat. The completely new smart phone shocked me. I easily indulged in the iphone, focusing on the screen almost all day. Only after a month, I found that I could not see the blackboard clearly. At first I thought it because the light was too dark. However, when my parents found that and sent me to the hospital and took an eyesight test. It was proved that my eyesight has been damaged harmfully. By that time, I came to realize that I had made a huge mistake. Had I used the iphone more regularily, I would have a better eyesight.
